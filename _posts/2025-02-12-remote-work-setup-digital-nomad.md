Are you looking for a traveling office, working abroad, and digital nomad setup?
As a weekend digital nomad, I have some recommendations for you.

I want to optimize how I work when traveling,
as I am lucky enough to do that occasionally. Hobbyist digital nomad.
This is a small guide on how I set up a to-go workstation.

I hate working from my laptop only. My posture is shit, the screen feels claustrophobic, and the keyboard (especially Mac) feels terrible. So I need something portable to compete with my nice monitor-arm setup at home. The idea is to get a portable monitor and a tripod.

Here's an interesting hack: I use the standard VESA mount on the back of my monitor to attach it to a tripod. After researching Reddit, I found the NEBULA tripod—typically used for holding projectors—provides excellent stability and sturdiness for this setup. To make the connection, I use a camera/tripod cheese plate with 75x75 M4 screws, which fits perfectly for mounting the monitor onto the tripod.
The M4 screws didn't fit perfectly, but adding a washer made everything tight and stable.
The trick was found here, by [user/arbitraryusername10](https://www.reddit.com/user/arbitraryusername10/).

## Mouse and keyboard

I am a creature of habit, and I prefer to use the same keyboard and mouse when working from home, in the office, and on the go. Also, when I play on the computer, which is why my mouse and keyboard are a bit overkill.
I am using Logitech G915 TKL keyboard and Logitech Pro Wireless mouse.

## USB Hub

I use a UNI USB-C hub that can handle a USB-C charger, so I can use it as a hub and charge my laptop simultaneously.

## Webcam, microphone and sound

I don't need a webcam; my laptop has one. And for the microphone and sound, I use "Bose QuietComfort Earbuds," which are nice with noise-cancellation.

## Monitor

There are many options, in varying price ranges. Here are some notes to look out for.

- Choose an inch size that is comfortable for you when traveling. I suggest **16-18" range**.
- Get anything with a **1920x1080** (1080p) resolution. Usually, it is the same resolution, no matter the screen's physical size.
- It **needs VESA mount**, preferably with **M4 screw size**.
- You can use a VESA mount with two or four screws. My experience is two is enough when the screw is thick enough.
- Note the length of the screw, as it needs to be precise. Use washers when required.

> ⚠️ __WARNING__: Do not buy a monitor with **M3 screw size** VESA mount. The screws are too small and will not hold anything. I tried it, and with any weight, it fell apart.

> Note: ASUS made a ZenScreen MB16QHG Portable Monitor, which seems interesting because it has a built-in tripod mount. However, it is a bit expensive.
